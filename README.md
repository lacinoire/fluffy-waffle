Transforming synchronous UML Sequence Diagrams to UML State machines using QVT Operational ðŸ’™

# Running / Development

You will need Java and a version of Eclipse with the [Eclipse Modelling Framework](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2019-06/r/eclipse-modeling-tools).

Import all the projects in this repository. `-behaviour`, `-io-automaton` and `-sequence` define our intermediate models for the model transformations. In `fluffy-waffle` you can find the transformations written in QVT Operational and the initial models to use in your run-configurations.
